Beat Maestro by Project Broomstick
==================================

Beat Maestro is the development of a musical conducting game!<br>
This game is for everyone of all ages who want to begin interacting with music in a new way!

Our project is available with use of a Leap Motion Sensor<br>
We chose this device because it made it more realistic in trying to create the gestures of a conductor.
