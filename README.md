Project Broomstick
============================
Alex, Destiny & Meghan

Project Broomstick is the development of a musical conducting game!<br>
This game is for everyone of all ages who want to begin interacting with music in a new way!

Our project is available with use of a Leap Motion - a sensor device requiring no hand contact or touching.<br>
We chose this device because it made it more realistic in trying to create the gestures of a conductor.

Added applistener python file that uses pygame.
Leap Motion is able to control circle with movements above the leap.
